Define Opponent Card Pool Create a predefined card pool for each opponent or boss (based on theme, strategy, or difficulty).
Shuffle & Draw At the start of each turn, draw cards randomly from this pool (similar to how the player draws from their deck).
Play Logic (AI) The AI then selects cards from its hand based on simple logic (e.g., AP available, priority effects, countering player's last move, etc.).

* Opponent starts each battle with a set amount of Stamina Points (SP). Each card played by the opponent reduces stamina by a certain amount (based on energy cost or card type). For instance:
    * Low-cost card (1 AP) → drains 5 SP
    * Mid-cost (2 AP) → drains 10 SP
    * High-cost (3+ AP) → drains 15–20 SP
* Attack Power Scaling: As stamina decreases, damage dealt is reduced proportionally.

Card Use + Stamina Cost Example
Turn Example:
* Medusa plays "Poison Arrow" (12 base damage, 1 AP)
* Current Stamina: 60 → Cost: 5 SP → New Stamina: 55 → Scaled Damage: ~10

Design Benefits
* Pacing Mechanic: Bosses hit hard early, then lose steam.
* Counterplay Opportunity: Players can focus on surviving until stamina is low.
* Encourages AP-efficient decks for the opponent to stay dangerous longer
