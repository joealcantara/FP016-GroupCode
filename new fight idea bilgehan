 **Card-Based Battle System**  

#*1. General Rules**  
- Players have a specific deck of cards.  
- Each turn, they hold **5 cards in hand**.  
- Cards are drawn randomly, and **one card can be played per turn**.  
- The battle is **turn-based**, with both sides (player & enemy) playing cards in turns.  

---  

#2. Card Types**  

   **Attack Cards**  
- **Light Attack:** Deals small damage but can be played quickly.  
- **Heavy Attack:** Deals high damage but causes a delay in the next turn.  
- **Interrupt Attack:** Cancels the enemy's spell if they are casting one.  

   **Defense Cards**  
- **Block:** Completely stops an incoming attack.  
- **Deflection:** Reduces incoming damage by **50%** and reflects the rest back to the enemy.  
- **Endurance:** Reduces the damage taken for the next **2 turns**.  

   **Magic Cards**  
- **Fireball:** Burns the enemy, causing extra damage over multiple turns.  
- **Ice Shield:** Reduces incoming damage by **50% for 2 turns**.  
- **Poison:** Deals low but continuous damage to the enemy for **3 turns**.  

   **Special Cards**  
- **Draw Cards:** Allows the player to **draw 2 new cards**.  
- **Energy Surge:** Enables the player to **play 2 cards in the same turn**.  
- **Tactical Move:** Lets the player **see one card in the enemy‚Äôs hand**.  

   **Hybrid Cards (Can Attack or Defend!)
Some cards have two different effects, and the player can choose one when played.
Examples:

-Balanced Strike: Deals 15 damage or reduces incoming damage by 5 for 2 turns.
-Mana Barrier: Blocks magic attacks or grants +1 energy when played.

   **Passive Cards (Grant Permanent Effects!)
These cards stay active for the rest of the battle and provide continuous bonuses.
Examples:

-Blood Sword: Restores 20% of damage dealt as health.
-Armor Mastery: Reduces all incoming physical damage by 10%.
-Magic Flow: Reduces the energy cost of all magic cards by 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3. Battle Flow**  
1. **Each turn, players have 5 cards in hand.**  
2. The player plays a card, then the enemy plays a card.  
3. If two cards interact:  
   - **Defense cards reduce or block incoming attacks.**  
   - **Interrupt attacks cancel enemy spells.**  
   - **Special effects are applied immediately.**  
4. **A new card is drawn after each turn**, keeping the hand at 5 cards.  
5. **The battle is won when the enemy‚Äôs HP reaches zero.**  

---  

# 4. Strategic Mechanics**  
-Card Management:** The strongest cards may be limited in number, requiring careful usage.  
- **Combos:** Some cards can be combined for unique effects.  
  - *(Example: "Ice Shield" + "Endurance" = A turn with no damage taken.)*  
- **Limited Resources:** Some powerful cards require energy and **cannot be used frequently**.  

#5. Card Hold System (Save Cards for Later!)
Players can skip playing a card in one turn to play 2 cards next turn.
This allows for stronger combos and tactical plays.

# 6 Overdrive System (Charge Up for a Powerful Move!)
The Overdrive bar fills up as the player attacks.
At 100% Overdrive, the player draws a special card that can be played for free!
Example Overdrive Cards:
‚ÄúBlade Storm‚Äù: Deals 40 damage to 3 enemies.
‚ÄúInevitable Death‚Äù: Instantly defeats an enemy if they are below 30% HP.
