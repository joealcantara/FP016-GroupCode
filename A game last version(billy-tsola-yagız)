Minitor


1. Objective:

The player, as the Honking Knight, must infiltrate the tyrant‚Äôs kingdom through an underground tunnel system to overthrow the ruler. However, the path is treacherous, guarded by Medusa and a Minotaur.
‚∏ª

Phase 1: Choosing the Path
‚Ä¢	Decision Point: The player can choose between storming the gates (high combat risk) or sneaking through a hidden cave (stealth and puzzle elements).
‚Ä¢	Choosing the cave leads to the Underground Tunnels, where the player must navigate darkness, evade traps, and face mythical creatures.
‚∏ª

Phase 2: The Cave Entrance
‚Ä¢	The cave is damp, with eerie sounds echoing through the walls. The player finds remnants of past adventurers.
‚Ä¢	Gameplay Features:
‚Ä¢	Torch Mechanic: Limited visibility without a torch; light attracts enemies.
‚Ä¢	Resource Gathering: Collect mushrooms for minor health regeneration.
‚Ä¢	Hidden Lore: Stone carvings hint at dangers ahead (Medusa and Minotaur).

‚∏ª

Phase 3: The Medusa‚Äôs Lair
‚Ä¢	The tunnels open into an ancient chamber where Medusa dwells, turning past adventurers into statues.
‚Ä¢	Gameplay Features:
‚Ä¢	Stealth or Combat: The player can sneak past Medusa by avoiding her line of sight or fight her directly.
‚Ä¢	Shield Reflection Mechanic: Using a polished shield (found earlier), the player can deflect her gaze back at her.

‚Ä¢	Gameplay Features:
‚Ä¢	Maze Navigation: The layout shifts, requiring memory and logic to escape.
‚Ä¢	Footstep Tracking: The Minotaur can hear the player; walking on stone is noisier than soft ground.
‚Ä¢	Trap Rooms: Some corridors lead to spike traps, dead ends, or hidden loot.
‚Ä¢	Chase Sequences: If the Minotaur spots the player, they must run and hide or fight.
‚Ä¢	Minotaur Fight Mechanics:
‚Ä¢	The Minotaur charges at the player‚Äîdodging at the right time causes him to crash into walls.
‚Ä¢	Stunning the Minotaur with Medusa‚Äôs Eye gives an attack opportunity.
‚Ä¢	Using a torch scares the Minotaur momentarily, allowing repositioning.
‚Ä¢	Victory Rewards:
‚Ä¢	Minotaur‚Äôs Horns (craftable into a powerful weapon or helmet).
‚Ä¢	Key to the Inner Kingdom Gate (needed for the next phase).

‚∏ª

Phase 5: Entering the Kingdom
‚Ä¢	Exiting the tunnels, the player emerges inside the kingdom walls, ready to begin their next phase of the rebellion against the tyrant.

‚∏ª

Gameplay Summary:
‚Ä¢	Stealth & Combat Options: Players can avoid or engage enemies.
‚Ä¢	Puzzle Mechanics: Navigating the maze and dealing with Medusa.
‚Ä¢	Resource Management: Torches, healing items, and special relics.
