How to Play

There will be diffrent pathways like fire and water game 

Players will have to make choice to choose their paths
- There will be signboards (they might be lying or it can be true)
- Player has to make his own decision
- Player might get lost and fall down and get damage
- Player can find secret abilities which improves his stats
- Player will meet diffrent boss depends on his pathway

*first path
Bıllys boss will come up
after slaying billys boss there will be 3 options 
(we can set a short story before all this happens to let player decide)
example. *finding a village next to sea
- first option / taking the boat
-second option / going in to forest
- third option / follow the stranger

If player choses boat he will fight with sea monster 
If he goes in to forest wolfs can attack and by slaying them we can earn gold to buy items
If he follows the stranger he will get scammed and loose money 

*Second path
Tsolas boss will come up
After slaying Tsolas boss player will follow tsolas story with the same example of mine or similar (it depends on Tsolas creativity)

*Third path
yagızs boss will come up 
After slaying yagızs boss player will follow yagızs story with the same example of mine or similar (it depends on yagızs creativity)

All this 3 path will meet at some point to let player to change his path (to allow diffrent pathways and to allow player to change his pathway)

Between these bosses we can add side quests to make this game longer or more complicated

examples
- going in to cave
- helping slave to escape
these will help us to gain gold and loots
