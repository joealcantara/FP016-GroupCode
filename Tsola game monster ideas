Phase 1: Choosing the Path
•	Decision Point: The player can choose between storming the gates (high combat risk) or sneaking through a hidden cave (stealth and puzzle elements).
•	Choosing the cave leads to the Underground Tunnels, where the player must navigate darkness, evade traps, and face mythical creatures.
⸻

Phase 2: The Cave Entrance
•	The cave is damp, with eerie sounds echoing through the walls. The player finds remnants of past adventurers.
•	Gameplay Features:
•	Torch Mechanic: Limited visibility without a torch; light attracts enemies.
•	Resource Gathering: Collect mushrooms for minor health regeneration.
•	Hidden Lore: Stone carvings hint at dangers ahead (Medusa and Minotaur).

⸻

Phase 3: The Medusa’s Lair
•	The tunnels open into an ancient chamber where Medusa dwells, turning past adventurers into statues.
•	Gameplay Features:
•	Stealth or Combat: The player can sneak past Medusa by avoiding her line of sight or fight her directly.
•	Shield Reflection Mechanic: Using a polished shield (found earlier), the player can deflect her gaze back at her.
•	Alternative Path: If the player finds blindfolded knight relics, they can fight without risk of petrification.
•	Victory Rewards:
•	Medusa’s Eye (can temporarily petrify enemies).
•	Stonebreaker Sword (strong against stone enemies).

Health Points (HP): 250
Special Attacks
1. Gaze of Ruin
    * Description: Medusa locks eyes with her target. If the player is in her line of sight, they begin to petrify over 3 turns.
    * Effect: Gradual immobilization unless blocked by a shield, blindfold, or cover.
    * Counter: Use polished shield to reflect, or avoid direct line of sight.
2.  Serpent Flurry
    * Description: Her snake hair lashes out wildly.
    * Effect: Area-of-effect melee damage + poison over time.
    * Radius: 1-tile (or close range)
    * Cooldown: 2 turns

 Strengths
* Petrification Gaze: Can quickly disable reckless players.
* Poison Attacks: Wears down enemies over time.
* Stone Camouflage: Blends in among statues, making it harder to detect her until it’s too late.
* High Magic Resistance: Spells have reduced effect unless they’re light-based.

 Weaknesses
* Reflective Surfaces: Her own gaze can be turned against her with a polished shield.
* Blind Tactics: Players using blindfold relics can avoid gaze effects entirely.
* Light-Based Attacks: Bright light or sun magic disrupts her powers and slows her movement.
* Sound Distraction: Loud noises (like tossed objects or clashing metal) can temporarily misdirect her attention.

Phase 4: The Minotaur’s Maze
•	The tunnels become a labyrinth, where the player must find their way through before the Minotaur finds them.
•	Gameplay Features:
•	Maze Navigation: The layout shifts, requiring memory and logic to escape.
•	Footstep Tracking: The Minotaur can hear the player; walking on stone is noisier than soft ground.
•	Trap Rooms: Some corridors lead to spike traps, dead ends, or hidden loot.
•	Chase Sequences: If the Minotaur spots the player, they must run and hide or fight.
•	Minotaur Fight Mechanics:
•	The Minotaur charges at the player—dodging at the right time causes him to crash into walls.
•	Stunning the Minotaur with Medusa’s Eye gives an attack opportunity.
•	Using a torch scares the Minotaur momentarily, allowing repositioning.
•	Victory Rewards:
•	Minotaur’s Horns (craftable into a powerful weapon or helmet).
•	Key to the Inner Kingdom Gate (needed for the next phase).

Health Points (HP): 300
 Special Attacks
1. Maze Charge
    * Description: The Minotaur locks onto the player and charges in a straight line.
    * Effect: Deals massive damage if it connects. If the player dodges at the last moment, the Minotaur crashes into a wall and becomes stunned for 2 turns.
    * Cooldown: 3 turns
2.  Earthshatter Slam
    * Description: The Minotaur slams his axe or fists into the ground.
    * Effect: Sends a shockwave in a cone, knocking the player back and causing temporary disorientation (reduced movement or blurred vision).
    * Range: Mid-range (3–4 tiles ahead)
    * Cooldown: 4 turns

Strengths
* Brute Force: High damage and strong melee resistance.
* Sound Tracking: Can locate the player based on noise, even without direct line of sight.
* Labyrinth Awareness: Knows hidden shortcuts and can ambush if the player backtracks or hesitates.

 Weaknesses
* Slow Recovery: Easily stunned when missing with charge attacks.
* Fire Aversion: Torches or fire-based attacks cause him to back off or become temporarily distracted.
* Petrification Vulnerability: Can be frozen briefly by Medusa’s Eye, bypassing his natural tankiness.
